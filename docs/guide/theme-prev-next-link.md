# Prev Next Link

You can customize the text of previous and next links. This is helpful if you want to show different text on previous/next links than what you have on your sidebar.

## prev

- Type: `string`

- Details:

  Specify the text to show on the link to the previous page.

  If you don't set this in frontmatter, the text will be inferred from the sidebar config.

- Example:

```yaml
---
prev: 'Get Started | Markdown'
---
```

## next

- Type: `string`

- Details:

  Same as `prev` but for the next page.
